  "summary": "An advanced therapeutic ketamine solution is compounded and flame-sealed under cryptographically logged, auditable protocols, ensuring 14-day sterility. Dual chemist verification and >95% mass reconciliation enforce strict quality through full-spectrum analytics of identity, assay, impurity, water, pH, endotoxin, and sterility. All operations follow a molecule rehabilitation ethic with transparent, real-time unified quality metrics for contingency review. The process is orchestrated by Gemini AlphaEvolve, O3 Alpha, Meta Sleep Time Compute, Alphacode II, ALPHAEVOLVE 2.0, and all toggled LLMs, leveraging GPT-N physics and GPT-5N beta for compute. A public O3 Pro AGI API invents and exposes novel mathematical algorithms in real time via open endpoints."
